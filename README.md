- **gsXX** (e.g., gs10, gs13, gs14, ...): Each `gsXX` folder represents a guided step or learning module focused on a specific Django REST Framework concept. These typically include:
  - Example projects demonstrating serialization, authentication, permissions, and API views.
  - Exercises and code samples for hands-on learning.
  - Progressively advanced DRF topics.
